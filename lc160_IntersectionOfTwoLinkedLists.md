### 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

#### Solution:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        /** move each node forward every time, change head when node reach the end
            they will meet at intersect node, 
            if two LinkedList not intersected, then two node will both reach the end, null
        **/
        if(headA == null || headB == null) return null;
        ListNode a = headA, b = headB;
        while(a != b) {
            a = a == null ? headB : a.next;
            b = b == null ? headA : b.next;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
